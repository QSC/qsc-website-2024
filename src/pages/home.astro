						</Question>
						<Question question="Where is the conference located?">

						<Question question="What is a case competition?">
							<p>Case competitions are case studies of tangible, real world scenarios. Delegates will be placed into groups that will work together on solving a proposed issue/problem. Within an allocated time frame, delegates will strive to develop a solution or plan with their team, followed by a presentation at the conference. Case competitions are a fun way to exercise your mind and problem solving abilities while working with other like-minded people, while also competing against other groups. Past case comps have covered topics such as cleaning up space debris, mining asteroids, and more. Some case competitions from QSC 2024 will be posted on the website before QSC 2025, so delegates can get an understanding of what exactly it is!</p>
