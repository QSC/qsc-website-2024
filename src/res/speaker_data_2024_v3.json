My primary research interests involve the Large Scale Structure (LSS) in the Universe. By studying its properties and evolution, we can make firm statements about the physical processes which must have been active. Despite -- or perhaps because of -- its size, the LSS is difficult to observe, and specialized instruments and surveys are required to study it. I work on two such instruments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). More locally, I've recently become involved in a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) project to study pulsar scintillation. Using the once-pioneering and recently re-commissioned Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO), along with India's Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we aim to use interstellar plasma lensing to resolve motion in the pulsar emission. Prior my current position, I was a postdoc in the McGill Cosmology Instrumentation Lab, working with Matt Dobbs. For most of 2008 I lived in the Antarctic as a winterover for SPT, and before that I was a graduate student at the University of Chicago. While there, I spent a lot of time on outreach projects, particularly within the MSCOPE program, working in and developing exhibits for the Museum of Science and Industry and Adler Planetarium, some of which are still in use.

For her thesis, she used full-orbit phase-resolved observations obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope to map the thermal emission of a variety of short-period exoplanets. From thermal maps of distant worlds, she characterizes their climate by measuring advective and radiative properties. At McGill, she led the detection of the usual westward hot spot offset in the atmosphere of the young hot Jupiter CoRoT-2b, which suggests that our current understanding of exoplanets is incomplete. With Spitzer, she also observed extreme seasonal variation on the massive hot Jupiter XO-3b caused by its eccentric orbit and put constraints on its internal heating.<br/><br/>More recently, she is interested in studying scorching hot rocky planets, i.e. lava planets, predicted to be covered with magma oceans. With undergraduate mentees, they revisited the Spitzer phase curve of the iconic lava world, 55 Cnc e, where they found a smaller hot spot offset than previously reported, as expected for these objects. At the Université de Montréal, she will continue to study lava worlds as geological worlds since they offer unique opportunities to study the interplay between the planetary interiors and their atmosphere. She is the principal investigator of a program with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to map the atmospheric temperature structure and constituents of the lava world K2-141b. In parallel, she will take her work on gas giant mapping to the next level by investigating the multidimensional nature of hot Jupiter atmospheres via spectroscopic observations with JWST.<br/><br/>When she is not thinking of planetary atmospheres, Lisa occasionally dabbles in exoplanetary gravitational microlensing. During her graduate studies, she held a visiting research fellowship at Caltech/IPAC to work on the Spitzer Microlensing Campaign aiming to constrain the distribution of exoplanets towards the galactic bulge.",

She obtained her Ph.D. in Physics & Astronomy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario in 2016. Her research focuses on galaxy formation and evolution, particularly those found in clusters. Nathalie is currently the Deputy Director of the Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iREx) and the Mont-Mégantic Observatory (OMM) at the University of Montréal and is also the Outreach Scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope in Canada collaborating with the Canadian Space Agency. She is a frequent contributor and analyst in Canadian media on everything related to space. She also organises and participates in science outreach events from local to international scales to encourage the interest and participation of youth and the general public in space science and to increase scientific literacy in Canada.",

      "bio": "Prior to joining KAICIID Andrzej served in various international leadership functions across several international organizations. These included the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris, the Fédération Internationale De Football Association (FIFA) in Zurich, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels.<br/><br/>While at NATO Andrzej also served as the Lead for Planning and Coordination, and the plenipotentiary of the Secretary General in the United Kingdom, for the preparation of the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales. In 2015 he was appointed as Principal Advisor to the Government of Poland on the planning of the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, for which he was made Knight of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.<br/><br/>In addition to his formal career path Andrzej has been space industry-adjacent for most of his life. He started this by becoming the first ever high-school intern at the Canadian Space Agency where he worked at the David Florida Laboratories at the time of the Radarsat and MSAT programmes. He has participated in numerous fora related to the commercial aspects of the global space industry, most notably over successive editions of the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, USA, and with the Space Foundation. Andrzej has also worked with early-stage space technology companies, helping identify opportunities linked to business strategy and access to funding. His most precious memory from this ‘shadow career’ is a lengthy exchange he had with Buzz Aldrin on the impact which space plays in global defence and security in the context of the emergence of BRICS economies, much of which has now come to pass.",
